Python is a simple and easy to understand programming language. It is a General Purpose language 
and it is being used in diverse fields like Data science, ML, AI, Web Development, Desktop apps etc.
It is very easy compared to C, C++, Java languages due to its almost English like Syntax.

** IMPORTANT points **:
High Level language
No need of ;(semi-colon) to terminate/differentiate code blocks/statements
Indentation used to make reader friendly language ( throws an error if u don't indent correctly)
 

 **First Python Program**:

    Print("Hello, World!")
     -> Hello, World!
