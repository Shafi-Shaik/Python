Python is a simple and easy to understand programming language. It is a General Purpose language 
and it is being used in diverse fields like Data science, ML, AI, Web Development, Desktop apps etc.
It is very easy compared to C, C++, Java languages due to its almost English like Syntax.

** IMPORTANT points **:
High Level language
No need of ;(semi-colon) to terminate/differentiate code blocks/statements
Indentation used to make reader friendly language ( throws an error if u don't indent correctly)
 

 **First Python Program**:

    Print("Hello, World!")
     -> Hello, World!


 ## Variables
     Variable is a name given to a memory space/location  that holds certain value which you can use in your program.

     rules of declaring variable name:
     1) Cannot Start with numbers, Special numbers (underscore '_' can be used )
     2) No White Spaces are allowed
     3)Case-Sensitive Apple & apple are two different variables as per python
     4)Keywords Cannot/Shouldn't be used as a variable name





 ##DATATYPE:  The type of value that is stored in a variable 
     There are multiple datatypes in Python. Primarily, there are 5 Basic datatypes
     
 1) Integer Literal
         e.g. num1 = 23, noOfRuns = 192 etc

 2) String Literal
          e.g. player = "Shafi", battingStyle = "Right hand batsman" etc

 3) Float
          e.g. cpga = 9.21, BattingAverage = 54.2033 etc

 4) Boolean
          isMarried = TRUE, isDied = FALSE

 5) None
         Hobbies = None, badHabits = None

                              Unlike other programming languages, we don't need to specify the datatype for each variable, 
python is smart enough to identify on its own.
